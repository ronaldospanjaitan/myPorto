About Me
This one was started in April 3rd after i finished DTS, I got my supplementary skills in FrontEnd mostly CSS elements.

I build this with TailwindCSS and in the next phase i want it to be completely responsive and ready to be implemented in ReactJS

I hope you 're liked it hihihi...

Regards,

Doddd
